## Geospatial Packages in R Lesson

Manipulate geospatial data with open source tools.

## Instructor Notes

**Note by Quentin 18 May 2021**: I just completely revised the raster part of this
lesson to use the stars package instead of the raster package. Note that stars
is still under development so there may be unexpected changes in the package that
might affect the code in the lesson. Currently a development version of stars
from GitHub is required for everything to work. Make sure you test the code 
before teaching the lesson. 

Also I created a folder called `internal_docs` in the repo which has a short
notebook describing how I created the cropped and downsampled NLCD raster we 
use in this lesson from the full NLCD2016 dataset, as well as code I used to
test out switching things from raster to stars.
