## Objectives for this lesson

This lesson presents a brief overview of some of the key R packages for geospatial analysis.
The R scripting approach to geospatial analysis may initially seem inconvenient or unintuitive, compared to the point-and-click interface of GIS software.
However, scripting an analysis pipeline makes it much easier for anyone - including the code's author - to re-create the same analysis on new or updated data.

## Specific achievements

- [load and plot vector layers](#importing-vector-data) (points, lines and polygons);
- [subset vector layers](#subsetting-vector-layers) based on associated data or on another layer (overlay);
- read projections and [transform coordinates](#coordinate-transformations);
- perform [geometric operations](#geometric-operations-on-vector-layers) (union, intersection and buffering) on polygon layers;
- [load, subset and plot raster layers](#working-with-raster-data) (grids of pixels);
- [filter (mask) and aggregate raster pixels](#raster-math);
- [extract raster values](#the-extract-function) based on a vector layer.
